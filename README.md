<b> <h1>Speed Calculation and Trajectory Of an Object Using Image Difference</h1></b>
 
 <p> This project aims at finding the speed of a moving object (preferably round ones) using the method of image difference.
 Object detection was done using OpenCV by pre-setting a colour range in the code file.
After identifying the object an outline is give around the object and the speed of the object is displayed along with the trajectory taken by the object in a new window
